2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

简单来说，就是求1到20的最小公倍数

解答：

'''

```Python
from functools import reduce
# 求两个数的最小公倍数
def lcm(m,n):
    if m>n:
        m,n=n,m
    r=1
    tiple = m*n
    while r!=0:
        r = n%m
        n = m
        m = r
    lcmNum = tiple/n
    return lcmNum
print(reduce(lcm,[11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]))
```

'''

答案是232792560.0
