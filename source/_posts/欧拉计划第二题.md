Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
find the sum of the even-valued terms.
翻译下：就是在斐波那契数列中找到小于4000000的那个数，然后求它之前的所有偶数的和并打印出来
even-valued terms 偶数
odd-valued terms 奇数
Ruby代码：
```Ruby
def fabonacci
  firstNum,secondNum = 0, 1
  sumNum = 0

  while secondNum < 4000000
    firstNum, secondNum = secondNum, firstNum + secondNum

    sumNum += secondNum if secondNum % 2 ==0
  end
  puts "The sum of all even-valued is #{sumNum}"
end
fabonacci()
```
输出结果：
```Ruby
The sum of all even-valued is 4613732
```
