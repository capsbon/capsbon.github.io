The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

这题比较简单，就直接放代码了

```Python
def euler6():
    sumSquare =0
    squareSum=0
    for i in range(1,101):
        sumSquare+=i*i
        squareSum+=i

    squareSum = squareSum*squareSum
    difference = squareSum - sumSquare
    print(difference)
euler6()
```
